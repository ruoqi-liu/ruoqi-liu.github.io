## Short Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University (OSU). I'm fortunately working with Prof. [Ping Zhang](https://www.pingzhang.net/) in AIMed (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) Lab. My research lies at the intersection of deep learning and causal inference, with applications in healthcare and biomedicine. I am particularly interested in estimating treatment effects to derive evidence-based, actionable healthcare decisions using real-world patient data.
